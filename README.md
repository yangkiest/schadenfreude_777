/ˈʃɑːdənˌfrɔɪdə/
a word sharp on the tongue,
a smile in the shadow of someone else's fall.

not because we are cruel—
but because we are honest.
because even in the quiet,
our hearts twitch when pride slips,
when masks crack,
when the untouchable stumbles.

i carry the name not to glorify pain,
but to understand it.
to hold the mirror to the soft monsters we all hide—
jealousy, bitterness,
a grin we’re too ashamed to admit.

this name is not celebration.
it’s confession.
a reminder that growth blooms
even in the darkest corner of emotion.
and sometimes,
we learn most
from the cracks we don't show in the daylight.
